Empath lets you perform client side sentiment analysis. It is designed to work with emails.

Features include:
- multilingual sentiment analysis (German and English supported currently)
- DISC profile analysis
- email signature recognition (so only the email body gets analysed)
- egoismAnalyser (so you can figure out how selfish someone is based on their communication)

Usage:

**Install module**

`npm install --save-dev empath-sentiment-analysis`

**Using Sentiment Analyser**

Modified from https://github.com/thisandagain/sentiment/blob/master/lib/index.js
```
import empath from 'empath-sentiment-analysis';
empath.analyseSentiment(phrase = '', attributesOfInterest = []);
```

Result:
```
{
    wordListDidNotMatch: tryAnotherWordList,
    score:          score,
    comparative:    score / tokens.length,
    tokens:         tokens,
    words:          words,
    positive:       positive,
    negative:       negative,
    attributeScores: attributeScores
};
```

Attribute scores are useful if you have a number of products for which you want to analyse sentiment. Review the test cases for more details.

**Using DISC Profile Guesser**

```
import empath from 'empath-sentiment-analysis';
empath.guessDISCProfile.getUserReadableDISCProfile(email);
```

result: 
```
{
    'D': D,
    'I': I,
    'S': S,
    'C': C,
}
```

or
empath.guessDISCProfile.getUserReadableDISCProfile(email);

result: two letters indicating primary and secondary profile, e.g. DC

**Using Email parser**

```
import empath from 'empath-sentiment-analysis';
const emailWithoutSignatureAndQuotedReplies = empath.parseEmail(email);
```

If you supply an email with a long signature and quoted replies from the thread, it will trim everything except the first email.

**Using Readability analyser**
```
import empath from 'empath-sentiment-analysis';
const readabilityScore = empath.calculateReadabilityScore(email);
```

Anything above 4.0 is considered advanced vocab

**Egoism analyser**

```
import empath from 'empath-sentiment-analysis';
const egoismScore = empath.analyseEgoism(email);
```
Result:
```
{
    selfish, 
    controlling, 
    conforming
};
```

Selfish = number of selfish words used
Controlling = number of command/imperative words used
Conforming = number of we/group style words

Ratio can yield interesting insights about personality
