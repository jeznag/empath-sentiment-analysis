Subject: Re: [##54329##] FTP Access
 
Hi Nour, 
 
Your website is the center of your online presence, it’s where google goes to cross-reference information that is broadcasted across the internet. One of the most crucial steps is making sure that your website is congruent with what all the work we are doing to get your Google Places listing on the front page. To do this we will need access to the following components of your website which you can get from your web developers or current website host.
 
FTP Access - This is the control panel for your hosting account for your website which will have a unique username and password. This will also be available from your website host.
 
Domain: 
 
Username: 
 
Password: 
 
Having access to the above components of your website are requirements for your campaigns ability to perform at its best. We will not be changing the way your website looks, just the back end meta tags that are used by search engines to determine what your business does.  We require this access within the next 7 days, the longer it takes for you to provide us with this information the longer it will take to get your business ranking on the front page. Please contact your website host to get this information. If you need further assistance please contact the support team at support@searchresults.com.au or give us a call at 1300 884 998.



We want to hear from you. How did you rate our customer service?
Good
Okay

Thanks for assistance.



The meeting was good day on the demo. Client seems OK with all points
except booking chart.

During Zoho Reports demo they found a chart view (as attached with
amendments here), which they like to use for their booking chart.

I would request you, if you could share the possibility of achieving it and
could be integrated with Zoho CRM, Creator, Reports.

I am just looking for your understating if it possible with investment
outline. I have mentioned some of the required points below –



·         The booking chart should auto update instantly, when the location
booking is approved in CRM.

·         Prior to booking when under approval, it should reflect in the
CRM too as mentioned in the image.

·         It should be interactive enough with ease of understating for all
viewers.

·         When a portion of status is hovered over, it should give basic
details about that (Client, Start Date, End Date, Agency/ Direct etc.)

·         The chart would be based on locations not on the calendar or
date, the mean here is, all locations will remain listed intact and can be
further filtered with other sub related details. (Status, Agencies,
Locations, Start/End Date, Status etc.).

·         Each location has a unique code, while hovering over to, it
should give details of it.

·         The page view should give monthly view as default which could be
customised based on weeks.

·         The chart should reflect the locations which are upcoming
available with differentiation. like before 7 days or so.. The CRM should
also send email to CRM user for this so they concentrate for new potentials.

·         A limited view access is to be given to some agencies based on
their relation with specific locations only.



More, they do also have a question about Account Management, would we be
able to handle a situation while two CRM users approach one client for
different services without having to look each other’s job on that.

Meanwhile, the admin or someone as manager can see overall on that
particular account. I was thinking it to be with Parent / Child relation.

Am I right on this, or what is your view?



Looking for your feedback.

Thank you very much.

I just wanted to see the possibility of achieving it, so I can educate same

Could you meanwhile help me with an investment outline of your work on all
these points including the required booking chart UI for actual project?



So, we could talk on commercial with client and setup the right
expectations.

BookedIn.com will probably not be appropriate because it can't do multi

there to show how it might look but to achieve the desired UI, we'll
probably need to build a custom booking system from scratch in
PHP/NodeJS/Zoho Creator.

Dear Jeremy,



Thanks for your update and suggestion.

They are looking some demo on

·         Location Booking Validation & Approval Flow (If a location is
already booked, it should be able to be booked again for that duration to
avoid human error. And each booking should go under multilevel approval.)

·         Installation Checklist Flow (Auto task assigned to Installation
team for particular Booking to take place)

·         Account Contact Management (when an End Client is dealt with
multiple channels for multiple interactions as direct or agencies)

·         Booking Chart (Ideal Hypothetical Images Can also work for demo)

·         Quote & Invoice Generation on these location booking

Ok. What kind of a demo are they looking for? The location chart would
require significant development.

It might be worth looking at using a third party platform like bookedin.com
rather than building the booking system from scratch. Bookedin could be
integrated with zoho crm relatively easily and inexpensively. ($700)

It can fulfill all the requirements out of the box.

https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/15SbhsIhrOSAfIJFrZth2jTOqXyR-R1PlLZZjMDpRdSw/edit#slide=id.p7



Do you need an estimate right away? I can give a worst case scenario
estimate based on what I know so far.

I'd say $700 for the Zoho CRM aspects (slides 1-3) and $3000 for the
booking system (slides 4-9). It would take 1 week for the CRM changes and
3-5 weeks for the booking system.

This is a worst case scenario estimate and would probably be less once I
have complete details.
